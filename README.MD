# Welcome to my Logs Project

This project was created using Python version 3.6.1, please see requirements.txt for any further requirements.

### What this program do
This program was designed to return the results of several queries and is set up for the ease of use for the user in 
mind. By having to only run the ```main.py``` program it couldn't be easier to see the results you were looking for.


### How to Run the program

1. Enter into the logs-project directory.
2. Go through connection.py and replace **kwargs for connection.
3. If you do not have the database initialized please do so now.
4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run main.py either by double clicking on the file or by typing ```python main.py``` into command while terminalled
into the logs-project folder.

#### Current Errors

1. I did some refactoring and now I get no output from authors.py
2. Confused on README requirement.
